## GCD-project
Project for Getting and Cleaning Data, Coursera.

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. We had to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The project has to obtain a non-tidy dataset of accelerometers data from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone (see: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).


The files include run_analysis.R, a tidy dataset (tidy.txt), and a codebook (CodeBook.md) and includes a data folder for the downloaded data files.
All code in this repository should be in the current director and the R script does install any required packages automaticaly
To run the code in R Studio execute this command - source("run_analysis.R")
The sciprt takes baout 10 minutes to complete, and pelase do not kill the script until it is done
After the run you will see a tidy.txt file in your current directory


## CodeBook.md

The CodeBook contains a description of the original dataset, the data acquisition process, the data transformation process, the variables, and the tidy dataset format.
